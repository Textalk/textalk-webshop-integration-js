Textalk Webshop Integration Example
===================================

This is an example of an external integration designed to be configurable from inside Textalk
Webshop admin.

Right now, this is just a bare skeleton that stores settings for each integration instance.  It
will be updated with API subscriptions to act on for integration.

Todo
----

* API client (jsonrpc client).
* API subscriptions (automatically managing subscriptions and listening to events).
